** DO NOT BLINDLY USE THIS. IT IS AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHAT IS POSSIBLE**

This Typescript implementation is an AI generated migration of the Python SDK to TypeScript, using the same architecture and design principles. It is not a direct translation but rather a reimagining of the SDK in TypeScript, leveraging its features and idioms.

It MUST NOT be taken as a Typescript SDK. The code has not been reviewed, but it has been tested and seems to work as is. Dot NOT paste any secrets or sensitive information in here.


# Read Me before all else.

This bit was written by me. The [Strands SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) is an open source Python SDK for building AI agents. It supports a load of Model Providers, including Bedrock, VertexAI, Ollama and more. It has some built in tools for doing things, allows you to integrate MCP servers into those Agents and has a REPL interface for interacting with the agents.

I'm by no means fluent in Python. I can read it, but I don't know the idioms or best practices. So I thought it would be fun to see if an AI could generate a TypeScript version of the SDK, using the same architecture and design principles. Over a couple of hours I coaxed Claude Code using Opus to generate a Typescript version of the SDK, using the same architecture and design principles. The result is a TypeScript SDK that is essentially an AI generated Typescript clone. It shouldn't be used. But I wanted to see how far you could get an AI to translate a whole load of code. I've not reviewed the code and 100% recommend you don't use the code. But I've used it and it runs. It loads MCP servers, it runs the agent. It's missing a load of features that make Strands great though. You should 100% go and check Strands out. It's great, so a huge thanks to the Strands team, and I'll continue my adventure learning Python, because I am running Strands Agents in Production and it's great..

Now, back to the AI generated code...

## SDK Usage

### Basic Agent
```typescript
import { Agent, BedrockModel } from '@strands/agent-sdk';
import { calculator, currentDate } from '@strands/tools';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: new BedrockModel({
    modelId: 'us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'
  }),
  tools: [calculator, currentDate],
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.'
});

const response = await agent.call("What is today's date?");
console.log(response.text);
```

### Custom Tools
```typescript
import { tool } from '@strands/agent-sdk';

const myTool = tool({
  name: 'my_tool',
  description: 'Does something useful',
  parameters: {
    input: { type: 'string', description: 'Input to process' }
  },
  handler: async ({ input }) => {
    return `Processed: ${input}`;
  }
});
```

### MCP Integration
```typescript
import { MCPClient, createStdioTransport } from '@strands/agent-sdk';

// Connect to MCP server
const mcpClient = new MCPClient(
  createStdioTransport('npx', ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem'])
);
await mcpClient.start();

// Use MCP tools with agent
const tools = await mcpClient.listTools();
const agent = new Agent({
  model: new BedrockModel(),
  tools: tools
});
```

### Multi-Agent Systems
```typescript
import { agentAsTool } from '@strands/agent-sdk';

// Create specialized agent as a tool
const researchTool = agentAsTool({
  name: 'researcher',
  description: 'Researches topics',
  agentFactory: () => new Agent({
    model: new BedrockModel(),
    systemPrompt: 'You are a research expert...',
    tools: [searchWeb, httpRequest]
  })
});

// Orchestrator uses specialized agents
const orchestrator = new Agent({
  model: new BedrockModel(),
  tools: [researchTool, writerTool],
  systemPrompt: 'You coordinate specialized agents...'
});
```

## AWS Configuration

The SDK requires AWS credentials to access Bedrock. Configure credentials using one of these methods:

1. **AWS CLI** (recommended):
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

3. **AWS Profile**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
   ```

4. **IAM Role** (when running on AWS infrastructure)

## Development

- SDK source: `packages/sdk/src/`
- Run SDK REPL: `pnpm --filter @strands/agent-sdk repl`
