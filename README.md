** DO NOT BLINDLY USE THIS. IT IS AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHAT IS POSSIBLE**

This Typescript implementation is an AI generated migration of the Python SDK to TypeScript, using the same architecture and design principles. It is not a direct translation but rather a reimagining of the SDK in TypeScript, leveraging its features and idioms.

It MUST NOT be taken as a Typescript SDK. The code has not been reviewed, but it has been tested and seems to work as is. Dot NOT paste any secrets or sensitive information in here.


# Read Me before all else.

This bit was written by me. The [Strands SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) is an open source Python SDK for building AI agents. It supports a load of Model Providers, including Bedrock, VertexAI, Ollama and more. It has some built in tools for doing things, allows you to integrate MCP servers into those Agents and has a REPL interface for interacting with the agents.

I'm by no means fluent in Python. I can read it, but I don't know the idioms or best practices. So I thought it would be fun to see if an AI could generate a TypeScript version of the SDK, using the same architecture and design principles. Over a couple of hours I coaxed Claude Code using Opus to generate a Typescript version of the SDK, using the same architecture and design principles. The result is a TypeScript SDK that is essentially an AI generated Typescript clone. It shouldn't be used. But I wanted to see how far you could get an AI to translate a whole load of code. I've not reviewed the code and 100% recommend you don't use the code. But I've used it and it runs. It loads MCP servers, it runs the agent. It's missing a load of features that make Strands great though. You should 100% go and check Strands out. It's great, so a huge thanks to the Strands team, and I'll continue my adventure learning Python, because I am running Strands Agents in Production and it's great..

Now, back to the AI generated code...


# Strands Agent SDK - TypeScript

A TypeScript SDK for building AI agents with a model-driven approach, migrated from the Python SDK.

## Workspace Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with the following packages:

```
strands-ts/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sdk/              # Core SDK (@strands/agent-sdk)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/          # SDK source code
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dist/         # Built JavaScript files
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/         # SDK documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/            # Built-in tools (@strands/tools)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/          # Tools implementations
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dist/         # Built JavaScript files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ demo-agent/       # Demo applications
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ src/          # Demo implementations
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Build the SDK:**
   ```bash
   pnpm build:sdk
   ```

3. **Run the demos:**
   ```bash
   # Interactive demo menu
   pnpm demo
   
   # Or specific demos
   pnpm --filter @strands/demo-agent assistant
   pnpm --filter @strands/demo-agent weather
   pnpm --filter @strands/demo-agent calculator
   ```

## Features

- âœ… **Event Loop Architecture** - Core agent loop with streaming support
- âœ… **AWS Bedrock Integration** - Full support for Claude models
- âœ… **Tool System** - Flexible tool creation with decorators
- âœ… **Built-in Tools Package** - Optional tools for common tasks
- âœ… **REPL Interface** - Interactive command-line interface
- âœ… **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and IDE support
- ðŸš§ **MCP Support** - Model Context Protocol (coming soon)

## SDK Usage

```typescript
import { Agent, BedrockModel, tool } from '@strands/agent-sdk';
import { calculator, currentDate } from '@strands/tools';

// Create an agent with specific tools
const agent = new Agent({
  model: new BedrockModel({
    modelId: 'us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'
  }),
  tools: [calculator, currentDate],
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.'
});

// Use the tools
const response = await agent.call("What is today's date?");

// Create custom tools
const myTool = tool({
  name: 'my_tool',
  description: 'Does something useful',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      input: { type: 'string' }
    }
  }
}, async ({ input }) => {
  return `Processed: ${input}`;
});

// Add custom tools
const agentWithTools = new Agent({
  tools: [myTool]
});
```

## AWS Configuration

The SDK requires AWS credentials to access Bedrock. Configure credentials using one of these methods:

1. **AWS CLI** (recommended):
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

3. **AWS Profile**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
   ```

4. **IAM Role** (when running on AWS infrastructure)

## Development

- SDK source: `packages/sdk/src/`
- Run SDK REPL: `pnpm --filter @strands/agent-sdk repl`
- Type check: `pnpm typecheck`
- Clean builds: `pnpm clean`

## Demo Agent

The demo package showcases:
- Basic conversational assistant
- Weather agent with custom tools
- Calculator agent with mathematical tools

See `packages/demo-agent/README.md` for details.

## Architecture

The SDK follows the same architecture as the Python version:

- **Event Loop**: Core execution engine that handles model interactions and tool execution
- **Agent**: High-level interface for interacting with models and tools
- **Models**: Abstraction layer for different model providers (Bedrock, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Tools**: System for extending agent capabilities with custom functions
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol support for tool integration

## Progress

See [packages/sdk/migration.md](./packages/sdk/migration.md) for the detailed migration plan and progress.
